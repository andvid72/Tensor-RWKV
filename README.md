# tensorflow-rwkv

Description:
This repository provides a TensorFlow implementation of the RWKV (Reversible Weighted Kernel) layer, a novel neural network architecture designed for long-range dependencies. RWKV is particularly effective for tasks like language modeling and machine translation.

Features:

Efficient long-range dependencies: RWKV can handle long sequences without suffering from vanishing gradients.
Flexibility: Can be used as a building block for various NLP tasks.
TensorFlow compatibility: Integrates seamlessly with the TensorFlow ecosystem.
